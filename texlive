# install texlive
tl;dr: Unix(ish)

Non-interactive default installation on anything but Windows:

    cd /tmp # working directory of your choice
    Download: wget https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
               or: curl -L -o install-tl-unx.tar.gz https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
    (or via whatever other method you like)
    zcat < install-tl-unx.tar.gz | tar xf - # note final - on that command line
    cd install-tl-*
    perl ./install-tl --no-interaction # as root or with writable destination
    # may take several hours to run
    Finally, prepend /usr/local/texlive/YYYY/bin/PLATFORM to your PATH,
    e.g., /usr/local/texlive/2024/bin/x86_64-linux 

Changing defaults:

    The default paper size is a4. If you want the default to be letter, add --paper=letter to the install-tl command.
    By default, everything is installed (7+GB).
        To install a smaller scheme, pass --scheme=scheme to install-tl. For example, --scheme=small corresponds to the BasicTeX variant of MacTeX.
        To omit installation of the documentation resp. source files, pass --no-doc-install --no-src-install to install-tl. 
    To change the main installation directories (rarely needed), add --texdir=/your/install/dir to install-tl. To change the location of the per-user directories (where TEXMFHOME and others will be found), specify --texuserdir=/your/dir.
    To change anything and everything else, omit the --no-interaction. Then you are dropped into an interactive installation menu.

1. Make sure that you can run the tex program in the first place:
> tex --version

2. Process a basic LATEX file, generating PDF:
> pdflatex sample2e.tex

3. Preview the PDF file, for example:
> xpdf sample2e.pdf

4. Of course you can still generate TEX’s original DVI format:
> latex sample2e.tex

5. And preview the DVI online:
> xdvi sample2e.dvi # Unix
> dviout sample2e.dvi # Windows

6. To create a PostScript file from the DVI:
> dvips sample2e.dvi -o sample2e.ps

7. Or to create PDF from the DVI, an alternate path to using pdfTEX (or XeTEX or
LuaTEX) which can be useful sometimes:
> dvipdfmx sample2e.dvi -o sample2e.pdf

8. Other standard test files you may find useful in addition to sample2e.tex:
small2e.tex A simpler document than sample2e, to reduce the input size if
you’re having troubles.
testpage.tex Test if your printer introduces any offsets.
nfssfont.tex For printing font tables and tests.
testfont.tex Also for font tables, but using plain TEX.
story.tex The most canonical (plain) TEX test file of all. You must type ‘\bye’
to the * prompt after ‘tex story.tex’.

9. If you have installed the xetex package, you can test its access to system fonts as
follows:
> xetex opentype-info.tex
