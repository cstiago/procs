1. Make sure that you can run the tex program in the first place:
> tex --version

2. Process a basic LATEX file, generating PDF:
> pdflatex sample2e.tex

3. Preview the PDF file, for example:
> xpdf sample2e.pdf

4. Of course you can still generate TEX’s original DVI format:
> latex sample2e.tex

5. And preview the DVI online:
> xdvi sample2e.dvi # Unix
> dviout sample2e.dvi # Windows

6. To create a PostScript file from the DVI:
> dvips sample2e.dvi -o sample2e.ps

7. Or to create PDF from the DVI, an alternate path to using pdfTEX (or XeTEX or
LuaTEX) which can be useful sometimes:
> dvipdfmx sample2e.dvi -o sample2e.pdf

8. Other standard test files you may find useful in addition to sample2e.tex:
small2e.tex A simpler document than sample2e, to reduce the input size if
you’re having troubles.
testpage.tex Test if your printer introduces any offsets.
nfssfont.tex For printing font tables and tests.
testfont.tex Also for font tables, but using plain TEX.
story.tex The most canonical (plain) TEX test file of all. You must type ‘\bye’
to the * prompt after ‘tex story.tex’.

9. If you have installed the xetex package, you can test its access to system fonts as
follows:
> xetex opentype-info.tex
