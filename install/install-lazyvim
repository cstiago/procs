# Make a backup of your current Neovim files:

# required
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}

# Clone the starter
git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim

# Remove the .git folder, so you can add it to your own repo later
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git

# Start Neovim!
nvim

# Refer to the comments in the files on how to customize LazyVim.
# It is recommended to run :LazyHealth after installation. This will load all plugins and check if everything is working correctly.
